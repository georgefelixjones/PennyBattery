# Penny Battery

### Equipment
- 10x copper 2p coins
- Cardboard
- Kitchen Foil
- Vinegar
- Salt

- (optional) sellotape
- Ampmeter
- Wires

### Method
Put the coins into a bowl, add vinegar and salt to cover. Stir and leave for around a minute or until coins are clean.
From the cardboard cut 9 2p sized pieces and soak in vinegar (do not add salt to this). Cut 9x 2p coin sized pieces from the kitchen foil.
To assemble the battery first put down one coin, on top of that place a piece of vinegar soaked cardboard and on top of that place on piece of kitchen foil. Place another 2p on top and repeat coin, card, foil, coin, card, foil, coin, card, foil....

Using an Ampmeter place the red and black connectors on the battery top and bottom. The reading should be around 2-4 volts.
